# Please Read!!!
These two sample files are following from this [tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/lora-and-lorawan-radio-for-raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-wiring). This tutorial is **very**
thorough and goes over the basics of these modules. We need to make a class that more closely resembles what is happening in the tutorial. One where you can both receive and send data seemingly simultaneously. We will have to learn these modules fairly in depth because we will be sending larger than recommended amounts of data over the radio connection. Here is a link to the [RFM9X adafruit Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_RFM9x).

## Future development
We need to figure out if this stuff will transfer over to a Raspberry Pi running Kali Linux. This is **_REALLY_** important for us because it will change wether or not we need
to add a microcontroller to our payload in order to communicate.
