Compiling and Running nmap_scanner.py
--

This code searches target device(s) located on a network. For this project, we have generated our [own network using a Raspberry Pi](https://thepi.io/how-to-use-your-raspberry-pi-as-a-wireless-access-point/). When nmap_scanner.py is ran, it will generate an output file containing a matrix full of information related to the target device(s). This information is **state**, **name**, **product**, **version**, **extra information**, and **cpe**. The most critical component of information is the **state**, as it will give the port number that is open on the target device. **Name** will give what the name of the product is, alongside its version number. The generated file nmap_scanner.py makes is called targets.txt. exploit.py will be using this file, tokenizing it, and running exploits scans on every single target device. The user can then choose which target device they want to exploit, and exploit.py will execute it. 

1. Run sudo apt-get update
2. Run sudo apt-get install nmap 
    - Warning: Might have to move the downloaded nmap directory into the python directory
3. Run python3 nmap_scanner.py<br>

MetaSploit and exploit.py
--

This code will open the **targets.txt** file that nmap_scanner.py generates. It will then look for potential exploits to run on every single target device listed, to which the user can choose a specific target device to exploit. Using an [open-sourced MetaSploit library](https://pypi.org/project/pymetasploit3/), the exploitation process is automated and exploit.py uses the byte payload generated by MetaSploit to compromise the user's chosen target device.

Installing MetaSploit
--

You'll want to use the [free installer](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Nightly-Installers) containing all the dependencies you will need to run exploit.py.

Using MetaSploit Console
--

Initiate MetaSploit with the command msfconsole. It may ask for you to initiate a password, set it to what is easy to remember. <br>

Compiling and Running exploit.py
--

You'll want to have msfconsole running in the background. It is going to be accessed by this script while it's running, so don't close out of it or run multiple instances. The latter will cause a traceroute error to occur. 

1. Run python3 exploit.py
