<h3> Compiling and Running nmap_scanner.py </h3>

This code searches target device(s) located on a network. For this project, we have generated our [own network using a Raspberry Pi](https://thepi.io/how-to-use-your-raspberry-pi-as-a-wireless-access-point/). When nmap_scanner.py is ran, it will generate an output file containing a matrix full of information related to the target device(s). This information is state, name, product, version, extra information, and cpe. The most critical component of information is the state, as it will give the port number that is open on the target device. Name will give what the name of the product is, alongside its version number. The generated file nmap_scanner.py makes is called targets.txt. exploit.py will be using this file, tokenizing it, and running exploits scans on every single target device. The user can then choose which target device they want to exploit, and exploit.py will execute it. 
1. Run sudo apt-get update
2. Run sudo apt-get install nmap 
    - Warning: Might have to move the downloaded nmap directory into the python directory
3. Run python3 nmap_scanner.py
