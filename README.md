Code, documentation, and other files related to Team Zephyr's capstone project at UT Arlington, Fall 2021-Spring 2022.

The project, working title Wardriving Drone, is to create a sensor payload for a commercial drone that uses software-defined radio(s) (SDR) to gain information about an RF emitter. The information is then sent down to a base station that uses the information to triangulate the emitter's location and map that estimated location using GPS.

This project is sponsored by Elbit Systems of America, who provided funding as well as project requirements and specifications. The Elbit point of contact (POC) was Richard Plumer.

This project is advised by Dr. Christopher McMurrough, Associate Professor of Instruction at The University of Texas at Arlington.
